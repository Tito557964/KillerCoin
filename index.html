                <p>Mass of the Penny
A modern U.S. penny weighs 2.5 grams (0.0025 kg) and is primarily composed of 97.5% zinc with a 2.5% copper plating.</p>
<p>A penny falling through the air reaches terminal velocity when the downward force of gravity balances with the upward force of air resistance, preventing further acceleration. Using physics equations, we calculated that a penny's terminal velocity is approximately 10.85 m/s (24.3 mph). This speed is reached because the penny, being a small and lightweight object with a relatively large surface area, experiences significant air resistance. Compared to dangerous speeds—such as a bullet's 300-900 m/s—a penny's impact force is negligible. Even at terminal velocity, the pressure it exerts on impact is only 86.5 N/m², which is drastically lower than the 1,000,000 to 16,000,000 N/m² required to break human skin. This confirms that a falling penny, no matter how high it is dropped from, cannot cause serious injury or death.</p>
            <p>Human skin is highly durable, requiring 16-30 MPa (16,000,000 - 30,000,000 N/m²) of pressure for blunt force trauma and 1-2 MPa (1,000,000 - 2,000,000 N/m²) for sharp objects to penetrate. High-speed impacts above 60-70 m/s can break skin depending on mass and impact angle. In comparison, a penny falling at terminal velocity (~10.85 m/s) exerts only 86.5 N/m² (0.0000865 MPa), which is over 10,000 times too weak to break skin.</p>
           <p>Blunt Force:
It requires significantly more pressure to break the skin because the force is distributed over a larger area.
For blunt trauma, skin usually tears indirectly due to underlying tissue damage rather than direct skin rupture.
Estimated pressure needed: >1000 psi (pounds per square inch) for a concentrated blunt impact.
Sharp Force (e.g., knives, needles):
It requires far less pressure because the force is concentrated on a small surface area.
Typical threshold: Around 50–200 psi for a sharp object like a scalpel or needle.

                <p>After making the experiment and coming up with the results, we decided to make a graph to show the different type of damage the jello took:</p>

                <p>In conclusion,the coin wont be able to make significant damage to a human head nor even kill a person. Since the coin fell down very slowly and when it fell it bearly penetrated the jello, meaning that a human head wouldnt take much damage</p>
